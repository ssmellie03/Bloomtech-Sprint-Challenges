Hello, my name is Shamara Smellie, and I am currently advancing my skills in data science through The Bloomtech Data Science program. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decision-making and develop analytical solutions that create meaningful impact. In addition to my technical pursuits, I bring a strong sense of patience, creativity, and empathy from my experiences working with children. Outside of my academic and professional development, I enjoy crocheting and reading, which help me stay focused, detail-oriented, and continually learning. I am eager to connect with others in the field and explore opportunities to contribute to data-driven projects.
